Minimal Node.js Docker Images (18MB, or 6.7MB compressed)
---------------------------------------------------------

This is a fork of `mhart/alpine-node` using the `alpine-kubernetes` base image.
Currently only built for `v6.9.4`, `v4.4.4`, and `v4.4.5` Please see the
[`alpine-kubernetes`](https://github.com/janeczku/docker-alpine-kubernetes) repo
for more info on how to use `s6` if you care to use that as the built in process
runner.
